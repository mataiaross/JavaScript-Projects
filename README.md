Weather ( Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.):
Challenge: 

Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.
Convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

Magic Eight Ball (In this project I built the Magic Eight Ball):
The user will be able to input a question, then my program will output a random fortune.

Race Day (This program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.):
Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.
Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

Sleep Debt Calculator
(In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.)
The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.

Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.

Training Days
 Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.
